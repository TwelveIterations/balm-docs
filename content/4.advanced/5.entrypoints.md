## Overview

In order for your mod to be loaded, you must create a mod-loader specific entrypoint inside each corresponding mod-loader subproject, and register your mod with Balm inside.

::tip
If you use the [balm-mod](https://github.com/TwelveIterations/balm-mod) template repository, this setup is already done for you.
::

To do that, you need to add calls to `Balm.initializeMod()` in each of your entrypoints - that is your `ModInitializer` on Fabric, and your `@Mod` class constructors in Neo/Forge.

Similarly, your `ClientModInitializer` and your client-side `@Mod` class (NeoForge only) should use `BalmClient.initializeMod()`. On Forge, wrap this call in a `FMLEnvironment.dist.isClient()` check. Examples for each mod loader are provided below.

## NeoForge

### neoforge.mods.toml

Your mod must come with a `neoforge.mods.toml` file that defines the metadata, dependencies and mixin configurations to load.

Refer to the [NeoForge documentation](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/gettingstarted/modfiles#neoforgemodstoml) to learn more.

### Common Entrypoint

```java [neoforge/src/main/java/NeoForgeWaystones.java]
@Mod(Waystones.MOD_ID)
public class NeoForgeWaystones {

    public NeoForgeWaystones(IEventBus modEventBus) {
        final var loadContext = new NeoForgeLoadContext(modEventBus);
        Balm.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, Waystones::initialize);
    }

}
```

### Client Entrypoint

```java [neoforge/src/main/java/NeoForgeWaystonesClient.java]
@Mod(value = Waystones.MOD_ID, dist = Dist.CLIENT)
public class NeoForgeWaystonesClient {

    public NeoForgeWaystonesClient(IEventBus modEventBus) {
        final var loadContext = new NeoForgeLoadContext(modEventBus);
        BalmClient.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, WaystonesClient::initialize);
    }

}
```

## Fabric

### fabric.mod.json

Your mod must come with a `fabric.mod.json` file that defines the `main` and `client` entrypoints to your entrypoint classes as well as all other metadata.

Refer to the [Fabric documentation](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/getting-started/project-structure#fabric-mod-json) to learn more.

:::tip
Balm provides a default [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) entrypoint to automatically expose your mod's configuration through supported config screens.

You should only need to define a custom `modmenu` entrypoint if you want to provide your own configuration screen or make other changes.
:::

### Common Entrypoint

```java [fabric/src/main/java/FabricWaystones.java]
public class FabricWaystones implements ModInitializer {
    
    @Override
    public void onInitialize() {
        Balm.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, FabricLoadContext.INSTANCE, Waystones::initialize);
    }

}
```

### Client Entrypoint

```java [fabric/src/main/java/FabricWaystonesClient.java]
public class FabricWaystonesClient implements ClientModInitializer {
    
    @Override
    public void onInitializeClient() {
        BalmClient.initializeMod(Waystones.MOD_ID, FabricLoadContext.INSTANCE, WaystonesClient::initialize);
    }

}
```

## Forge

### mods.toml

Your mod must come with a `mods.toml` file that defines the metadata and dependencies to load.

Refer to the [Forge documentation](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/gettingstarted/modfiles/#modstoml) to learn more.

Also note that Forge uses the `MixinConfigs` manifest attribute to define mixin configurations. 
On the template projects this is already taken care of, but otherwise you may have to adjust your gradle files to set the attribute accordingly.

### Common & Client Entrypoint

```java [forge/src/main/java/ForgeWaystones.java]
@Mod(Waystones.MOD_ID)
public class ForgeWaystones {
    final var loadContext = new ForgeLoadContext(context.getModEventBus());
    Balm.initialize(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, Waystones::initialize);
    if (FMLEnvironment.dist.isClient()) {
        BalmClient.initialize(Waystones.MOD_ID, loadContext, WaystonesClient::initialize);
    }
}
```

:::tip
This looks scary because it's accessing client-only code from a common context, but it's actually safe in modern Java as long as the methods involved are all static.
:::

## Third Party Mod Compatibility

The mod-loader specific entrypoints are also a good place to initialize addon compatibility classes that are only present in your mod-loader subprojects.

You can use `Balm.initializeIfLoaded` to only load the given class if the mod is present, avoiding a hard dependency on the third party mod. 

```java [Example]
Balm.initializeIfLoaded("exnihilosequentia", "net.blay09.mods.excompressum.compat.ExNihiloSequentiaIntegration");
```

:::warning
Don't use `YourIntegration.class.getName()` as that will cause the class to be loaded even if the third party mod isn't present, which would lead to a crash if that class happens to access any classes from the third party mod.
