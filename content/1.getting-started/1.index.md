## What is Balm?

Balm allows you to write code once and build your mod for [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/), [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) at the same time. For this, Balm provides abstractions to all common functionality such as registries and events.

Additionally, Balm comes with utilities to integrate popular mods like [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei), [Jade](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jade) or [Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) all on a single common codebase.

## Prerequisites

In order to use Balm, you should have

- an understanding of Java and Minecraft Modding
- an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- the ability to clone a [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) repository

## Creating a Project

Use this generator to download a blank mod with everything already set up.

::balm-project-generator
::

You can extract the generated zip file, open the project in your IDE, and jump straight to the [next page](/getting-started/mod).

Alternatively, you can use the [template repository](https://github.com/TwelveIterations/balm-mod) on GitHub. However, you will have to follow the steps in the README and manually update the template with your own names and properties.

## Adding Balm to an Existing Project

If you already have a project you're trying to port to Balm, the steps depend on whether you are currently on a multi-loader Gradle setup or not.

The following guides give a rough overview on how to migrate your setup to one that supports Balm

### a) Using the mod loader's official MDK / Project Template

The templates offered by mod loaders are designed for single-loader projects.

To support multiple loaders at once, you will have to upgrade your Gradle setup to one that supports multi-loader projects.

You can reference the existing template in the [balm-mod](https://github.com/TwelveIterations/balm-mod) repository. It essentially comes down to replacing most of your `build.gradle` files, adding the `build-logic` folder from the template, and moving your source code from `src/main/java` to `common/src/main/java`.

You will still have a folder for each loader you target, but they will generally only contain your mod's entrypoint (e.g. the Fabric `ModInitializer` or NeoForge `@Mod` class).

Once you've got a working Gradle setup, you have to add Balm as a library (see below), and finally you have to initialize your mod with Balm in each loader-specific entrypoint. Learn how your loader-specific entrypoints should look like in the [entrypoint](/advanced/entrypoints) section.

### b) Using another multi-loader template

Add Balm as a library like you would any other dependency:

```groovy [common/build.gradle]
repositories {
    maven {
        url = 'https://maven.twelveiterations.com/repository/maven-public/'
        content {
            includeGroup 'net.blay09.mods'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("net.blay09.mods:balm-common:${balm_version}") {
        changing = balm_version.endsWith('SNAPSHOT')
    }
}
```

```groovy [fabric/build.gradle]
repositories {
    maven {
        url = 'https://maven.twelveiterations.com/repository/maven-public/'
        content {
            includeGroup 'net.blay09.mods'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation("net.blay09.mods:balm-fabric:${balm_version}") {
        changing = balm_version.contains('SNAPSHOT')
    }
}
```

```groovy [neoforge/build.gradle]
repositories {
    maven {
        url = 'https://maven.twelveiterations.com/repository/maven-public/'
        content {
            includeGroup 'net.blay09.mods'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("net.blay09.mods:balm-neoforge:${balm_version}") {
        changing = balm_version.contains('SNAPSHOT')
    }
}
```

```groovy [forge/build.gradle]
repositories {
    maven {
        url = 'https://maven.twelveiterations.com/repository/maven-public/'
        content {
            includeGroup 'net.blay09.mods'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("net.blay09.mods:balm-forge:${balm_version}") {
        changing = balm_version.contains('SNAPSHOT')
    }
}
```

You will have to initialize your mod with Balm in each loader-specific entrypoint. Learn how your loader-specific entrypoints should look like in the [entrypoint](/advanced/entrypoints) section.

## Using Balm for only some or one loader(s)

That works too — just follow the setup guides and remove the loaders you don't want from the `include`s in your `settings.gradle` file. Everything else stays the same.
