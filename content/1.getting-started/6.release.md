Congratulations on your new mod!

Before releasing it into the wild, you should make sure some things are set up correctly so players won't run into issues.

### Mod Metadata

When releasing your mod, make sure that your mod metadata files declare a dependency on Balm.

If you used the Balm Project Generator or the [balm-mod](https://github.com/TwelveIterations/balm-mod) template repository, this is already the case.

```json [fabric/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json]
  "depends": {
    "balm": ">=${balm_version}"
  }
```

```toml [fabric/src/main/resources/META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml]
[[dependencies.yourmodid]]
modId="balm"
mandatory=true
versionRange="[${balm_version},)"
ordering="NONE"
side="BOTH"
```

```toml [fabric/src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml]
[[dependencies.yourmodid]]
modId="balm"
mandatory=true
versionRange="[${balm_version},)"
ordering="NONE"
side="BOTH"
```

If you're adding these lines, make sure your Gradle setup correctly replaces the `${balm_version}` placeholder as well.

### File Dependencies

You should also declare Balm as a `Required Dependency` on your CurseForge / Modrinth upload. That way players installing your mod with a Launcher will have Balm installed automatically alongside your mod.

## Mod Hosting Platforms

Balm is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balm) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/balm).

Third Party Downloads are enabled, so Balm can be easily installed even outside of the official CurseForge / Modrinth Apps. 

::note
For Minecraft versions 1.21.1 and below, Fabric versions of Balm were on a [separate CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balm-fabric). If you are releasing for those versions, make sure to select the correct project for the file you are uploading.
